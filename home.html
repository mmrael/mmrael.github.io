    <center><h1><b>~ The Haunted House ~</b></h1></center>

    <h2>It's a dark night.</h2> 
    You drive along a road, winding your way through a forest. Rain pelts down on your windsheild. Trees shroud the path, and you squint to see anything ahead of you. You try to remember your way home, and you try to forget the stories the townspeople told you about the old house on the hill... <BR><BR>
        People in the town claim to have seen strange, spooky things around the house. Things they fail to describe... Late at night, they say the wind carries the house's moans and screams. 
        <BR><BR>
            The rain assails even harder now. The road narrows, and the twisted branches scratch the side of your vehicle.
            <BR><BR>
